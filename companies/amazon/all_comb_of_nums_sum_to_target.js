/**
 * Alternative Question: Find All Combination of Numbers Sum to Target

    Given a positive integer, target, print all possible combinations of positive integers that sum up to the target number.

    For example, if we are given input ‘5’, these are the possible sum combinations.

    1, 4
    2, 3
    1, 1, 3
    1, 2, 2
    1, 1, 1, 2
    1, 1, 1, 1, 1
    The output will be in the form a list of lists or an array of arrays. Each element in the list will be another list containing a possible sum combination.
