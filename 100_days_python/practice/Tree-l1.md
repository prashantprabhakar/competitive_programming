## Properties

* The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2l-1.
* Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2h – 1.
* In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1)
* A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least Log2L + 1   levels
* In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children (Full Binary Tree), number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.



## Types

Full Binatry Tree: A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children

Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible

Perfect Binary Tree : A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.


Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes
